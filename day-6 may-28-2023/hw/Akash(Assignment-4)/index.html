                    <h1>Justin Trudeau</h1><br><br>
                    <h4>Trudeau supported the Liberal Party from a young age, offering his support to party leader John Turner in the 1988 federal election.[96] Two years later, he defended Canadian federalism at a student event at the Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, which he attended.[97] Following his father's death, Trudeau became more involved with the Liberal Party throughout the 2000s. Along with Olympian Charmaine Crooks, he co-hosted a tribute to outgoing prime minister Jean Chrétien at the party's 2003 leadership convention, and was appointed to chair a task force on youth renewal after the party's defeat in the 2006 federal election.[98][99]
                    In October 2006, Trudeau criticized Quebec nationalism by describing political nationalism generally as an "old idea from the 19th century", "based on a smallness of thought" and not relevant to modern Quebec. </h4> <br> <br>
